# True Evolutionary AGI 

## Motivation
Inspired by Voyager - the first LLM-powered embodied lifelong learning agent in Minecraft that continuously explores the world.
However Minecraft is an API driven virtual digital world, when it comes to real world can I reproduce the same?

In this project, I take an initial step towards enabling general tools making skills for AGI to have LLM create their own reusable tools for problem-solving in the real world.
