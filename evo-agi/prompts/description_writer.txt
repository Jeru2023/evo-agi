Understood. Here is the plan to complete the task:
Task: crawl a web page from given URL and return content as text.
Explain: None
Plan:
Import the requests module to make HTTP requests to the URL.
Use the requests.get() method to retrieve the HTML content of the web page.
Use BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content and extract the desired information.
Return the extracted information as text.
Class: WebCrawler
Code:
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

class WebCrawler:
    def __init__(self, url):
        self.url = url

    def extract_information(self):
        response = requests.get(self.url)
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
        extracted_information = soup.get_text()
        return extracted_information
This code defines a class named WebCrawler that takes a URL as input and has a method named extract_information() that retrieves the HTML content of the web page, parses it using BeautifulSoup, and returns the extracted information as text.
